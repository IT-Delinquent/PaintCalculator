# PaintCalculator

This is a simple script that provides calculations for painting a wall 🎨 🖌️

This scripts takes in the following inputs:
 - Wall Length
 - Wall Height
 - Paint Coverage
 - Paint Price
 - Tax
 
 And outputs a nice little "reciept" as you can see below:

As you can probably tell, it's not the most comprehensive calculator. However, it is probably the first "thing" I ever created in PowerShell and I wanted to come back and make it nicer. I'm going to leave it here just for the sake of sharing something 😊
